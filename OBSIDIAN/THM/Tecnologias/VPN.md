**Virtual Private Network**

Consider a company with offices in different geographical locations. Can this company connect all its offices and sites to the main branch so that any device can access the shared resources as if physically located in the main branch? The answer is yes; furthermore, the most economical solution would be setting up a virtual private network (VPN) using the Internet infrastructure. The focus here is on the V for Virtual in VPN.

When the Internet was designed, the TCP/IP protocol suite focused on delivering packets. For example, if a router gets out of service, the routing protocols can adapt and pick a different route to send their packets. If a packet was not acknowledged, TCP has built-in mechanisms to detect this situation and resend. However, no mechanisms are in place to ensure that **all data** leaving or entering a computer is protected from disclosure and alteration. A popular solution was the setup of a VPN connection. The focus here is on the P for Private in VPN.

Almost all companies require “private” information exchange in their virtual network. So, a VPN provides a very convenient and relatively inexpensive solution. The main requirements are Internet connectivity and a VPN server and client.

The network diagram below shows an example of a company with two remote branches connecting to the main branch. A VPN client in the remote branches is expected to connect to the VPN server in the main branch. In this case, the VPN client will encrypt the traffic and pass it to the main branch via the established VPN tunnel (shown in blue). The VPN traffic is limited to the blue lines; the green lines would carry the decrypted VPN traffic.

In the network diagram below, we see two remote users using VPN clients to connect to the VPN server in the main branch. In this case, the VPN client connects a single device.

Once a VPN tunnel is established, all our Internet traffic will usually be routed over the VPN connection, i.e. via the VPN tunnel. Consequently, when we try to access an Internet service or web application, they will not see our public IP address but the VPN server’s. This is why some Internet users connect over VPN to circumvent geographical restrictions. Furthermore, the local ISP will only see encrypted traffic, which limits its ability to censor Internet access.

In other words, if a user connects to a VPN server in Japan, they will appear to the servers they access as if located in Japan. These servers will customise their experience accordingly, such as redirecting them to the Japanese version of the service. The screenshot below shows the Google Search page after connecting to a VPN server in Japan.

Finally, although in many scenarios, one would establish a VPN connection to route all the traffic over the VPN tunnel, some VPN connections don’t do this. The VPN server may be configured to give you access to a private network but not to route your traffic. Furthermore, some VPN servers leak your actual IP address, although they are expected to route all your traffic over the VPN. Depending on why you are using a VPN connection, you might need to run a few more tests, such as a DNS leak test.

Finally, some countries consider using VPNs illegal and even punishable. Please check the local laws and regulations before using VPNs, especially while travelling.
