a pretty basic ability that a hacker needs to learn 
was trasnfer files. wget **allow us to download files** from the web via *http*

we only need to provide the address of the resouce we wish to download.


**Ejemplo** : if i wanted to download "myfile.txt" onto my machine, assuming i knew the web address it.

`wget https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/linux-fundamentals/part3/myfile.txt`

[[wget y scp]]
