Adding [[TLS]] to [[SMTP]], [[POP3]], and IMAP is no different than adding TLS to [[HTTP]]. Similar to how HTTP gets an appended S for _Secure_ and becomes [[HTTPS]], [[SMTP]], [[POP3]], and IMAP become [[SMTPS]], [[POP3S]], and IMAPS, respectively. Using these protocols over TLS is no different than using HTTP over TLS; therefore, almost all the points from the HTTPS discussion apply to these protocols.

### insecure versions 
use the default TCP port numbers shown in the table below:

| Protocol | Default Port Number |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| HTTP     | 80                  |
| SMTP     | 25                  |
| POP3     | 110                 |
| IMAP     | 143                 |

### secure versions
, i.e., over TLS, use the following TCP port numbers by default:

|Protocol|Default Port Number|
|---|---|
|HTTPS|443|
|SMTPS|465 and 587|
|POP3S|995|
|IMAPS|993|

TLS can be added to many other protocols; the reasoning and advantages would be similar.
